# eventsvxo

## Product description
This is an API that handles events within the Swedish city - Växjö. It is an application that is meant for professional use.

Companies and organisations can create and modify events that will be stored into a database. They will have to authenticate themselves as a company or organisation to avoid private people creating personal events. It will also list all of the already created events, where they can edit information or/and remove an event. 

The reason for visiting the application is to easily create a new event, and also to modify an already existing event that is hosted by the company/organisation.

This product will be useful for developers who want to implement event information in Växjö. It can also be used as a guideline to help developers create a similar or more advanced product.
